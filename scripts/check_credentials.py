"""Are this vault's passwords actually being kept out of its backup?

A vault seeded before the secret-patterns fix shipped with no `.gitignore` at
all, so the first save would have committed its own credentials. Anyone who
installed in that window has real Google tokens in a folder that may be
tracked, and nothing tells them.

    python3 System/scripts/check_credentials.py

Four questions, worst first, each with the command that fixes it:

  1. Is a credential tracked by git right now?
  2. Was one ever committed, even if it has since been removed? Git history is
     permanent, so a token in an old commit is still a live token.
  3. Does `.gitignore` cover every pattern a credential lands in?
  4. Is a credential file readable by other accounts on this machine?

It only reads. Nothing here revokes, deletes or commits anything, because the
one irreversible step in a leak, reissuing the token, has to be the owner's.

Exit 0 clean, 1 if something needs doing.
