"""Turn an empty folder into a working vault.

Run it from the folder you want the vault to live in, once the system is
cloned inside it:

    mkdir ~/Documents/MyVault && cd ~/Documents/MyVault
    git clone https://github.com/edoardop06/jarvis.git System
    python3 System/scripts/install_vault.py

It seeds the vault from the system's `template/`, wires the agent settings and
the commit check, generates the index tables, and runs the checker. It refuses
to touch a folder that already has notes in it unless you pass --force, because
overwriting somebody's Me.md is not recoverable from here.

Everything it creates belongs to this vault alone. The system stays in System/,
is never edited here, and is updated by version tag.
