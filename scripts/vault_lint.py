Vault lint script for the vault.

Errors (exit 1):
  1. Bare wikilinks: [[Note Name]] without a full vault-relative path.
  2. Missing summary field on Atlas and Effort notes.
  3. Broken wikilinks pointing to files that do not exist.
  4. Entry-point drift: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md differ in content.
  5. Unknown status values (vocabulary lives in Skills/Data Models/YAML Metadata Standard.md).
  6. Generated views out of sync with frontmatter (build_views.py --check).

  7. Unescaped pipes in table wikilinks (Obsidian drops those graph edges).
  8. Orphan notes: every note must have at least one inbound wikilink
     (Archive, Inbox, and entry points excluded).
  9. Stray instruction files: any CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md or equivalent
     other than the two at the vault root. Agents load nested ones silently.
 10. Frontmatter that does not parse (a note then reads as having no settings).

Warnings (reported, exit 0):
  - Onboarding left half-finished, or the config and the maps disagreeing
    about who owns this vault.
  - Permissions granted once via "always allow" and never surfaced since.
  - System work that is stranded: uncommitted, unpushed, or untagged.
  - Active efforts with no update in 30+ days.
