"""Do agents read the entry files, and which skills do they actually use?

Two questions, one scanner, because both are answered by reading the local
Claude Code and Codex transcripts and neither can be answered by asking an
agent to report on itself.

    python3 System/scripts/entry_compliance.py           entry-file compliance
    python3 System/scripts/entry_compliance.py --skills  per-skill usage
    python3 System/scripts/entry_compliance.py --json

CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md both say to read Me.md and Active Context before any
task. Whether that happens has never been checked. The default mode counts it.
It exists because the answer turned out to be "usually not, in short sessions",
and a rule nobody follows is worse than no rule: it looks like protection while
providing none. Re-run it after changing the entry path to see whether the
change moved the number.

--skills answers the separate question of which skills earn their place in the
startup listing. The listing is capped, so every exposed skill spends budget in
every session whether or not it fires. A skill nobody reaches is paying rent.

Both modes read what the runtime writes, never what an agent chose to record:
Claude logs a Skill tool call carrying the skill id, and a Read carrying the
note path; Codex logs the shell call whose arguments hold the path. An agent
that decides not to mention using a skill still leaves both traces.

Counts only. No transcript text is ever printed or returned: these files are
known to contain credentials that past sessions read, and they sit outside the
vault where .gitignore cannot reach them.
