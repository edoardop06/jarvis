"""Refuse to publish a personal detail inside the shared rules file.

`Agent Rules.md` is the one file whose contents are loaded by every agent in
every installation. It is also the newest way for this system to leak: before
it existed there was no shared prose file to write a name into by accident.

This repository already paid for that mistake once. CHANGELOG.md records why
there is no history before v2.0: the earlier commits "carried the author's own
name, email, home paths and other personal detail", and publishing them would
have made all of it permanent and public. A tag cannot be amended, so the check
has to happen before the commit, not after the release.

    python3 scripts/check_shared_rules.py            # check, print, exit 1 on a hit

Two kinds of pattern. The universal ones need no vault and always run, so the
check works in the system repository where there is no vault to read. The
derived ones are the owner's own name, the people they keep notes on and their
effort names, read from the vault when the script is running inside one.

Exit code 0 means clean, 1 means something personal is in there, 2 means the
file is missing.
