"""The impersonality check must cover every file that ships, not one.

check_shared_rules.py inspected only Agent Rules.md. It reported "clean,
nothing personal in the shared card" on every run of a branch that shipped
the owner's first name in seven skills and scripts, including the sentence
"push only when <owner> has asked for it" in a workflow every adopter loads.

MAINTAINER_RULES.md forbids personal names in shared files, plural. The
checker enforced it for one.
